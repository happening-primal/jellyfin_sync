Jellyfin Sync


This script was adapted from Emby2Jelly (Marc-Vieg - https://github.com/Marc-Vieg/Emby2Jelly) to add the functionality to specify the location of the settings.ini file from the command line.

The original script has the location of the settings file hardcoded into it.  The change allows for the sync'ing of multiple jellyfin severs using the single script.
